# Google Hash Code 2017

This is a repository for Google Hash Code competition, online qualification round, held in February 2017.

We took the opportunity to do a little bit of pair programming and trying the buzz of delivering a task in a short period of time, just like we did at University!

All of the code is here for educational purposes. Quite frankly, we're not even sure if it's totally correct. But we are absolutely sure we had fun writing it.
